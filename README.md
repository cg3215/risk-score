# Machine Learning Applications in reducing Unwanted Communications
This project aims to detect unwanted communications (e.g. spam, phishing, messages text recipients would opt out of) preemptively and prevent Programmable SMS product users from suffering financially due to spam and phishing.

Project Steps:
1. Define "unwanted communications" in the realm of SMS as spam, phishing, and any messages the text recipients would opt out of
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify customer cohorts that are driving the most unwanted communications
3. Clean the data and calculate metrics at the account level and message level for feature engineering
4. Use models like Decision Tree, KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbors), Random Forest, and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to train algorithms
6. Evaluate machine learning model performance by comparing it against Fraud-Specialist manually reviewed data and demonstrate and over 450x time efficiency with 95% accuracy
