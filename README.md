# Machine Learning Applications in reducing Unwanted Communications on Twilio Programmable SMS Platform
This project aims to detect unwanted communications (e.g. spam, phishing, messages text recipients would opt out) preemptively and prevent Programmable SMS product users from suffering financially due to spam and phishing.

Project steps:
1. Define "unwanted communications" in the realm of SMS ass spam, phishing, and any messages the text recipients would "opt-out"
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify customer cohorts that are driving the most unwanted communications
3. Clean the data and calculate account level and message level metrics for feature engineering
4. Use models like Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and PCA to train the algorithms
6. Evaluate model performance using data manually reviewed by Fraud Specialists
